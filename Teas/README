I had a little difficulty locating your app.js file, but luckily I came accross it after some digging! I couldn't get your code to run on my Titanium, I'm not sure if it's because you weren't able to connect the two windows as you noted at the bottom of your code. One of the first chapters from Programming Assignment Two demonstrates how to connect windows with a line of code, so maybe next time reference that. I noticed that you did the Camera application, which is different fromt the one that I chose so it was nice to see how you went about that. I think on line 63 you were trying to open a new window, but didn't do it correctly. A new window should look like a new tab. Overall, I think that if you would have had a few more hours to work out the kinks it would have worked well! Good job!
